"""
Often, when dealing with iterators, we also get a need to keep a count of iterations. Python eases the programmersâ€™ task by providing a built-in function enumerate() for this task. 
Enumerate() method adds a counter to an iterable and returns it in a form of enumerating object. This enumerated object can then be used directly for loops or converted into a list of tuples using the list() method.

# Python program to illustrate
# enumerate function in loops
l1 = ["eat", "sleep", "repeat"]

# printing the tuples in object directly
for ele in enumerate(l1):
    print(ele)
print
# changing index and printing separately
for count, ele in enumerate(l1, 100):
    print(count, ele)

# getting desired output from tuple
for count, ele in enumerate(l1):
    print(count)
    print(ele)
